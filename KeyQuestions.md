# Key Questions
## Unit 1
1. Should THE YES target Fashionistas or Fashion Followers?
   1. THE YES should target Fashion Followers as the brand caters specifically to personalized interests. 
 
2. Based on their similarities and differences, how would you further optimize the app to better appeal to Fashionistas? To Fashion Followers? Is it possible and/or desirable to try to satisfy both? Why or why not? If yes, how? If no, which one would you prioritize?
   1. To appeal to Fashionistas, it would optimize the app to offer a cyclic history of fashion trends and data with respect to how those trends influenced their current followers. It would optimize the app to also provide predictions of returning trends along with the potential follower gain or loss along with those trends. It would optimize the app to provide a competeting Fashionistas follower count in order to Fashionistas to see the effect of other Fashionistas trend-setting lifestyle on their follower count so that they may obtain or retain a competitive advantage. It would optimize the app to allow a link tree for Fashionistas to promote their personal page to their followers. 

3. What do the early results indicate about product/market fit? What excites you and what worries you? 
   1. The results that the app was downloaded by 30,000 users with a majority completing the onboarding quiz, clicking "yes" & "no" on items, and providing 2.5 million preference actions indicates a good market fit. 

4. Should Bornstein and Aggarwal invest in improving the algorithmâ€™s performance to improve customer satisfaction before they begin pouring money into paid media? Why or why not?
   1. Bornstein and Aggarwal should invest in improving the algorithm's performance to improve customer satisfaction before spending money into paid media because in the modern day, the quality of the product and word of mouth from customer satisfaction will drive products due to free advertising through social media. Tesla is a perfect example of a company that is succesful by focusing on customer satisfaction through the creation of a high quality product without paid media. 

5. How should the early results in Exhibit 13 and 14 inform THE YES's digital media spend strategy?
   1. In Exhibit 13 there should be an investigation into a potential relationship between 2nd week retention regressed onto the other predictors (installs, quiz completion, YES list, and total orders). There should also be an inquiry in predicting the total orders regressed onto the other variables in order to identify an exploitable opportunity to maximize the profits of the company. At first glance, it appears that there is a relationship between sharing and 2nd Week Retention, & also Paid Social media and the total number of orders. Given this intuition, the company should invest in paid social media if the goal is to increase profits & the total number of installs.

        - Brand-supported-loyalty-program: The pros of a customer loyalty program include increased customer retention and an opportunity cost of capital investment in more effective solutions respectively.
