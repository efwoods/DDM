Key Questions for Case Reading and Peer Learning Discussion

1. How should Mohsen allocate the FY21 digital marketing budget across various digital channels (Exhibit 9) and course offerings (Exhibit 10)? Consider the following as you decide on the budget allocation:

   1. In FY20, Mohsen allocated only 3% of her ad budget on programmatic display ads even though they have the lowest acquisition cost (see Exhibit 9a). Why?
      1. Excluding Bing DSA which were not invested in during FY19,  programmatic display ads have the penultimate fewest leads and middling revenue acquisition costs, enrollment, & app submissions. During FY19, Google DSA & Google Search had the lowest RAC. In comparison to Google Search & Google DSA, programmatic display ads had less leads, enrollment, & application submissions with a higher RAC. This supports the hypothesis that the investment in programmatic display ads in FY20 was based upon the results of FY19.

   2. According to Exhibit 10, CORe accounted for almost 24% of overall revenue but only 9% of the total ad spend in FY20. Is Mohsen under-spending on this course and overspending on others?
      1. After observing the data, it appears that the RAC, is the third lowest. Investing in CORe given the Digital Ad Spend by Course for FY20 appears to be an apt financial decision. 

   3. What is the best way to decide how much to spend on branded and generic ads (Ex 10)?
      1. The best way to decide how much to spend on branded and generic ads is to make a prediction using collaborative filtering and cosine similarity to predict the paid revenue  given the Ad Spend. This prediction may be used to calculate the predicted RAC. The cosine similarity of each course/campaign must first be calculated with respect to ad spend & paid leads. This will indicate which course/campaign is most similar to either branded & generic ads. Then the course/campaign that is most similar may be used to make the prediction of paid revenue.

2. How can Mohsen improve the enrollment or customer acquisition process to reduce acquisition cost and improve the effectiveness of paid media?
   1. If short form courses or learning tracks are offered, offer discounted courses to students who are about to complete their current enrollment based on short form courses that are similar to the course that they are currently in or a learning track that is in alignment with the course they most recently completed.

3. What opportunities exist beyond paid media to accelerate growth?
   1. HBS Could sponsor in person conferences, competitions, & events where the speakers host results of their work & advertise HBSOnline. For example, a course in robotic development could be taught online followed by an in-person robotics competition event that open to the public. 

4. Would you invest in short-form content and learning tracks to accelerate growth of HBS Online?
   1. I would investigate the demand of short-form content & learning tracks and the practicality of doing so. Given that HBS Online courses are 30 hours of course content and working professionals only require a single module within economics, I would want to know what the course expectations were of the short-form content. If what needs to be known of a particular topic is possible to deliver in short-form, then investing in short-form content could potentially be a way to increase growth if there is enough demand. This content could also be used ideally in a modular sense to create learning tracks. However, the content itself must be cohesive and modular such that the expected outcomes may be delivered. 

5. How would you address the concerns about brand dilution and the potential overlap between HBS Online and other programs of the school? How can HBS Online best fulfill the mission of the school?
   1. I would address concerns about brand dilution and the potential overlap between HBS Online and other programs of the school by using a model akin to MIT OpenCourseWare where the lectures are recorded and hosted publicly online for free, but the degree quizes, projects, and tests are accessible via a paid program with fellow cohorts, an accessible teaching assistant, and an accessible instructor to answer clarifying questions. This would allow for peer collaboration and a sense of trust with the course content seeing as the course content is the recording of the actual lecture. I would also host example results of the class and testimony in order to show that the work done in the class is beneficial to the individual's personal growth & aspirational goals.
